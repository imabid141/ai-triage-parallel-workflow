      "1. **Malicious PowerShell Execution**: A suspicious command decoded to download and execute a remote script from a known malicious C2 server (IP: 103.55.2.18), bypassing security policies and using obfuscation.  \n",
      "2. **Privileged Account Abuse**: The attack exploited the elevated privileges of the service account `svc_backup`, a high-value target for lateral movement or data exfiltration.  \n",
      "3. **Stealthy Tactics**: Use of temporary directories (`C:\\Windows\\Temp\\`) and hidden windows suggests an attempt to evade detection.  \n",

      "- **Terminate Suspicious Processes**: Kill the malicious PowerShell process and remove any payloads from `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\`.  \n",

      "- **Review `svc_backup` Activity**: Audit logs for unauthorized access, password reuse, or anomalous behavior.  \n",
      "- **Reset Credentials**: Immediately change the password for `svc_backup` and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) if not already in place.  \n",
      "- **Restrict Privileges**: Re-evaluate the necessity of elevated permissions for service accounts and apply the principle of least privilege.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Forensic Analysis and Threat Hunting**  \n",
      "- **Conduct Memory/Disk Forensics**: Analyze FIN-SRV-04 for residual malware, persistence mechanisms, or additional IoCs.  \n",
      "- **Check for Lateral Movement**: Scan the network for signs of compromise on other systems, focusing on servers with similar privileges.  \n",
      "- **Reverse Engineer the Payload**: Analyze `shell.ps1` (if recovered) to understand its capabilities and attribution.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Strengthen Defenses**  \n",
      "- **Update PowerShell Security Policies**: Enforce stricter execution policies and monitor for obfuscation techniques.  \n",
      "- **Enhance Monitoring**: Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect anomalous PowerShell usage, service account activity, and C2 patterns.  \n",
      "- **Patch and Harden Systems**: Ensure all systems are updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities exploited in such attacks.  \n",
